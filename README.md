1. Create a NodeJS server that serves static HTML and CSS files to the user without using Express.
2. Create a NodeJS server using Express that stores data from a form as a JSON file and displays it in another page.
The redirect page should be prepared using Handlebars.
3. Create a NodeJS server using Express that creates, reads, updates and deletes students' details and stores them in
MongoDB database. The information about the user should be obtained from a HTML form.
4. Create a counter using AngularJS.
5. Create a Todo application using AngularJSStore the data to a JSON file using a simpleNodeJS server and retrieve the
information from the same during page reloads.
6. Create a simple Sign up and Login mechanism and authenticate the user using cookies.The user information can be
stored in either MongoDB or MySQL and the server should be built using NodeJS and Express Framework.
7. Create and deploy a virtual machine using a virtual box that can be accessed from thehost computer using SSH.
8. Create a docker container that will deploy a NodeJS ping server using the NodeJSimage..
9. Build an online MCQ quiz app. The questions and options should be fetched based on the chosen topic from a NodeJS
server. The questions can be stored in a JSON file in the backend. Once the user has answered the questions, the
frontend must send the chosen options to the backend and the backend must identify the right answers and send the
score back to the front end. The frontend must display the score in a separate neatly designed page.
10. Build a blog website where you can add blog posts through a simple admin panel and the users can view the blog
posts. The contents of the blog posts can be stored in either MongoDB or MySQL database. The home page should
contain the titles of the blog post and the full post can be viewed by clicking the title. Frontend can be built either using
AngularJS or through template engines served by the NodeJS server.
11. Build a simple calculator app with AngularJS. The user should be able to add numbers and operations to the app by
clicking on buttons, just like you would do in a mobile phone. The moment the operation and the two operations are
defined, the answer should be displayed.
